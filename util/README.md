## Util

Contains utility functions that work with standard / sytem libraries.

These do things like add functions we'd really like to have in the core STL container APIs but don't. Auotmatically looping read/write so that we always read just the right amount, etc.

Classes which turn Standard library objects into RAII, considerably modify functionality, etc. do not go here. They go in base.
