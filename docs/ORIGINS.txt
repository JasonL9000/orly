Orly is a fork of the open source graph database StigDB produced by a small
team that had been working exclusively on the project at Tagged, Inc. for the
past four years. That team now works for OrlyAtomics, Inc and is continuing to
develop this large-scale database, distributed runtime environment, and
programming language.
